# Nightstand

A python project for Raspberry Pi to control some audio files for falling asleep in combination with BTAudio setup to connect bluetooth speakers like JBL Flip 4. Therefore I installed a NeoTrellis Keypad with RGB lightning into a Ikea Kallax 1x1 and connected it via I2C to the Raspberry Pi.
